The header #include <cctype> in C++ (from the C Standard Library <ctype.h>) provides character classification and transformation functions that work on char types (promoted to int).

Here’s a list of the most commonly used functions from <cctype>:

✅ Character Classification Functions
Function	Description
isalpha(ch)	Checks if ch is a letter (A–Z or a–z)
isdigit(ch)	Checks if ch is a digit (0–9)
isalnum(ch)	Checks if ch is a letter or digit
isupper(ch)	Checks if ch is an uppercase letter (A–Z)
islower(ch)	Checks if ch is a lowercase letter (a–z)
isspace(ch)	Checks if ch is a whitespace (space, tab, etc.)
ispunct(ch)	Checks if ch is a punctuation character
isxdigit(ch)	Checks if ch is a hex digit (0–9, a–f, A–F)
iscntrl(ch)	Checks if ch is a control character
isprint(ch)	Checks if ch is printable (including space)
isgraph(ch)	Checks if ch is printable (excluding space)

🔁 Character Conversion Functions
Function	Description
toupper(ch)	Converts ch to uppercase (if lowercase)
tolower(ch)	Converts ch to lowercase (if uppercase)

⚠️ Notes:
All these functions take an int (usually a char promoted to int) and return non-zero (true) or 0 (false).

You must include #include <cctype> to use them.
